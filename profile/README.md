The da Vinci Research Kit (**dVRK**) is an “open-source mechatronics” system, consisting of electronics, firmware, and software that is being used to control research systems based on the now retired first-generation da Vinci system from [Intuitive Surgical Inc](https://www.intuitive.com/).  The da Vinci system is designed for Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RAMIS).  The dVRK is now deployed in close to [40 differents institutions worldwide](/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/Timeline).

The dVRK documentation is hosted on the :point_right: [sawIntuitiveResearchKit Wiki](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki) :point_left:.  Please check the build instructions in the Wiki before cloning any repository.  The build instructions show how to use `wstool` or `vcs` to pull all the repositories you might need for ROS 1 or ROS 2.

Repositories:
* **dVRK**: [sawIntuitiveResearchKit](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit) Main repository for the dVRK.  This code depends on the *cisst* libraries but doesn't require ROS.
* **ROS 1**: [dvrk-ros](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/dvrk-ros): Single repository containing ROS nodes for the dVRK, configuration files (URDF and CAD), Python and Matlab clients API over ROS, examples...
* **ROS 2**: :warning: ROS 2 support is new and barely tested.  The code is split across multiple repositories.  [ros2_dvrk_robot](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/ros2_dvrk_robot): ROS node for the dVRK.  [ros2_dvrk_model](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/ros2_dvrk_model): configuration files (URDF and CAD).  [ros2_dvrk_python](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/ros2_dvrk_model): Python client API over ROS
